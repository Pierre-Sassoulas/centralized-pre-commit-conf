Easily install and update centralized pre-commit hooks and their
configuration files in decentralized repositories.

To be able to validate and automatically fix commits we're using
[git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

We're also heavily relying on `pre-commit`, which is a framework for managing
and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Please refer to the
[pre-commit documentation here](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Philosophy

In order to be able to install all the tools and linters in a single
command with up to date configuration, we're copying the configurations
files of your tools (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `isort.cfg`, `.flake8`,
 `.clang-format`, ...) from an URL to your local git directory and we
 then install `pre-commit`.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install centralized-pre-commit-conf
pre-commit-conf --help
```

## Â Result

For example with this configuration:

```
CONFIG_FILES = [".flake8", ".isort.cfg", ".pre-commit-config.yaml", ".pylintrc"]
```

`pre-commit-conf` will recover the defined configuration files and
update the `.gitignore`:

```
# Configuration file added automatically by 'centralized-pre-commit-conf'
.isort.cfg
.pylintrc
.flake8
.pre-commit-config.yaml
```

Next commit supposing the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is done correctly
your modified files we be linted with the centralized configuration.
