Easily install and update centralized pre-commit hooks and their
configuration files in decentralized repositories.

To be able to validate and automatically fix commits we're using
[git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks).

We're also heavily relying on `pre-commit`, which is a framework for managing
and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Please refer to the
[pre-commit documentation here](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Philosophy

In order to be able to install all the tools and linters in a single
command with up to date centralized configurations, we're copying the
configurations files of your tools (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `isort.cfg`, `.flake8`,
 `.clang-format`, ...) from an URL to your local git directory and we
 then install `pre-commit`.

Why not use only `pre-commit` by @asotile? Well, [in his words](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/450#issuecomment-405616722):

> pre-commit will not directly support mutability in configuration
(this includes referencing a centralized repository). This causes
lots of issues with repeatability and maintenance in general. This
was an early design decision after seeing the pain caused at scale
when a linter changes behaviour and suddenly every repository's
master branch is broken.

So if you disagree and want decentralized repository with centralized lint configuration,
you need a tool on top of pre-commit to shoot yourself in the foot anyway.

More seriously, the alternative is to use
[all-repos](https://github.com/asottile/all-repos) to mass update a
bunch of decentralized repositories with a decentralized configuration.

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install centralized-pre-commit-conf
```

## Usage

See `pre-commit-conf --help` for options.

### Installing hooks

For example with this `config.yaml` in [one of the appropriate
search paths](https://confuse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#search-paths):

```yaml
configuration_files :
    - ".pylintrc"
    - ".pre-commit-config.yaml"
repository: https://mycompany.net/lint-conf/
branch: master
path: "pre-commit/static/"
gitignore_info_text: "# Configuration file added automatically by 'centralized-pre-commit-conf'"
```

`pre-commit-conf` would recover the defined configuration files from
`https://mycompany.net/lint-conf/master/pre-commit/static/` and update the `.gitignore`:

```bash
‚ú® Successfully retrieved .pre-commit-config.yaml ‚ú®
‚ú® Successfully retrieved .pylintrc               ‚ú®
‚ú® Updated .gitignore successfully with {'.pre-commit-config.yaml', '.pylintrc'}. ‚ú®
 üéâ 2 configuration files recovered and pre-commit installed correctly. üéâ
```

Here would the content of the `.gitignore`:

```ini
# Configuration file added automatically by 'centralized-pre-commit-conf'
.pre-commit-config.yaml
.pylintrc
```

Then with the same configuration, using `pre-commit-conf --branch
hardcore-pylint-conf` would try to recover the configuration files
from `https://mycompany.net/lint-conf/hardcore-pylint-conf/pre-commit/static/`
instead.

```bash
Found existing .pre-commit-config.yaml ‚ÅâÔ∏è  Use '-f' or '--replace-existing' to force erase.
Found existing .pylintrc               ‚ÅâÔ∏è  Use '-f' or '--replace-existing' to force erase.
All configuration files already existed.
```

Next commit supposing the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is done correctly
your modified files we be linted with the centralized configuration.

## Development / contribution

```bash
pip3 install -e ".[test]"
pre-commit-conf
python3 -m pytest --cov centralized_pre_commit_conf
```
